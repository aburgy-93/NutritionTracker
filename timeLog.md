| 2/22/25 | Fixed the UserFood entity to use a many to many relationship with User and Food entities, which allows me to <br/> pass those entities through methods and use the object directly rather than having to use an id                                                                                                          | 2     |       |

| 3/26/25 | Worked on adding AWS authentication. I have the users pool set up and I can get users to sign up, but currently having an issue with authentication/logging into the app. Posted in the help page on slack.                                                                                                                 | 4     |       |
| 3/27/25 | Worked on integrating consuming an API (USDA food search API). I'm able to get the data from the API, but having issues getting the data out of the response. The response body is so large that it is hard to see<br/> everything that is in it.                                                                           | 8     |       |
| 4/3/25  | Tried working on getting the data out of the USDA search response. Still having issues with getting the data out. I think it would be better if when I make an API call to not just get the response and try to get the food facts out of the response, but <br/> map the data returned to the FoodsItem or Nutrients POJO. | 3     |       |
| 4/3/25  | After spending some time on the above work and not getting any further for now I worked on the UI for adding a meal to the DB and the backend logic for it. Way more complicated than I originally anticipated, but the UI was easy to make and get hooked up.                                                              | 5     |       |
