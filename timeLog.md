| 3/26/25 | Worked on adding AWS authentication. I have the users pool set up and I can get users to sign up, but currently having an issue with authentication/logging into the app. Posted in the help page on slack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 4     |       |
| 3/27/25 | Worked on integrating consuming an API (USDA food search API). I'm able to get the data from the API, but having issues getting the data out of the response. The response body is so large that it is hard to see<br/> everything that is in it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 8     |       |
| 4/3/25  | Tried working on getting the data out of the USDA search response. Still having issues with getting the data out. I think it would be better if when I make an API call to not just get the response and try to get the food facts out of the response, but <br/> map the data returned to the FoodsItem or Nutrients POJO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 3     |       |
| 4/5/25  | After spending some time on the above work and not getting any further for now I worked on the UI for adding a meal to the DB and the backend logic for it. Way more complicated than I originally anticipated, but the UI was easy to make and get hooked up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 5     |       |
| 4/7/25  | Not sure why or if it is a Federal Government thing, but USDA api is no longer working/online, so had to find a new API. Going with spoonacular API which is free up to 150 requests a day. Worked on setting up the DAOs and getting the responses from Postman into the application. Much easier than USADA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 4.5   |       |
| 4/10/25 | Worked on getting the data from the API request and listing out the food that match the search term entered in by the user. Then started working on getting the food data from the response into a form for the user to update date, mealtime, servings, servings unit, ect. <br/> Also worked on the logic to enter a user created meal into the table on the backend. Will have to do the same for when a user searches for a food.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 7.5   |       |
| 4/12/25 | Added the ability for users when they search for a food to click on the food and have the food data auto populate in the form. Created a script that will update the nutritional data based on the input they have for the serving size. Started to work on getting the form to submit a new food from the searched food into the food table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 4     |       |

| 4/17/25 | Updated the script to update the add food forms for both the user food table and the search food api. Got the post request to add a new food from the search food api to add the food to the user food table and add the new food to the tracker. Added Javadoc and comments to java classes. Added/fixed the ability to advance a week ahead in the tracker or go back a week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 7     |       |

| 4/22/25 | Worked on getting the newly organized food tracker data to be printed to the screen. Worked on the layout of the food tracker calendar to show each meal time, each food with their nutrition, and the sum total of food nutrition for that day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 5     |       |

Added JS scripts to update the Edit food in the food tracker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 3.5   |       |
| 4/24/25 | Added the functionality to edit a meal in the food tracker and to delete a meal in the food tracker. Making sure to reload the food tracker after adding or deleting a meal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 5     |       |
| 4/25/25 | Got the foodName from the UserFood object and added it to the FoodTracker display. Added JavaDoc for Controllers, entities, and persistence objects. Updated the foodTrackerScript.js to check for null values and to set them to 0 if null.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 3     |       |
| 4/29/25 | Didn't spend much time working on the project directly, but got it ready to deploy to beanstalk and reviewed what I needed to do for AWS Cognito only to notice potential problem I had. My users DB and much of my functionality relied on getting the user's id from the table from their name, but Cognito doesn't return their name as a claim, or doesn't based on how I set it up. Will need to fix DB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2.5   |       |
| 5/01/25 | As I suspected the user's DB was not set up in a way that could work with Cognito. I had to rebuild my database and remake the test database. Then fix the UserDao and UserfoodDao tests to get them passing again. Was also having issues with my cleanDB.sql file not resetting the test db when I ran the tests, but got it working again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 6     |       |
| 4/02/25 | After getting the tests to work again I worked on getting the user's info (username, email, sub) from them logging into Cognito. I'm using the sub attribute to then get the user out of the user's DB since it will be a unique string for each signed up user. After that I created a results class to return the logged in data from Cognito. I then set up a HttpSession to set the results onto the session attribute so I can use the data in other jsps or servlets. The big step today was using the sub attribute to get the user who is associated with it and get their food tracker data to display in the jsp. I will work next on using that sub to allow users to add food, delete food, add food to their table. | 4.5   |       |
