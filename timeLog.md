| 2/22/25 | Fixed the UserFood entity to use a many to many relationship with User and Food entities, which allows me to <br/> pass those entities through methods and use the object directly rather than having to use an id                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2     |       |

| 3/26/25 | Worked on adding AWS authentication. I have the users pool set up and I can get users to sign up, but currently having an issue with authentication/logging into the app. Posted in the help page on slack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 4     |       |
| 3/27/25 | Worked on integrating consuming an API (USDA food search API). I'm able to get the data from the API, but having issues getting the data out of the response. The response body is so large that it is hard to see<br/> everything that is in it.                                                                                                                                                                                     | 8     |       |
| 4/3/25 | Tried working on getting the data out of the USDA search response. Still having issues with getting the data out. I think it would be better if when I make an API call to not just get the response and try to get the food facts out of the response, but <br/> map the data returned to the FoodsItem or Nutrients POJO.                                                                                                           | 3     |       |
| 4/5/25 | After spending some time on the above work and not getting any further for now I worked on the UI for adding a meal to the DB and the backend logic for it. Way more complicated than I originally anticipated, but the UI was easy to make and get hooked up.                                                                                                                                                                        | 5     |       |
| 4/7/25 | Not sure why or if it is a Federal Governemnt thing, but USDA api is no longer working/online, so had to find a new API. Going with spoonacular API which is free up to 150 requests a day. Worked on setting up the DAOs and getting the responses from Postman into the application. Much easier than USADA.                                                                                                                        | 4.5   |       |
| 4/10/25 | Worked on getting the data from the API request and listing out the food that match the search term entered in by the user. Then started working on getting the food data from the response into a form for the user to update date, mealtime, servings, servings unit, ect. <br/> Also worked on the logic to enter a user created meal into the table on the backend. Will have to do the same for when a user searches for a food. | 7.5   |       |
| 4/12/25 | Added the ability for users when they search for a food to click on the food and have the food data auto populate in the form. Created a script that will update the nutritional data based on the input they have for the serving size. Stareted to work on getting the form to submit a new food from the searched food into the food table.                                                                                        | 4     |       |
| 4/14/25 | Still working on getting the form submitted data into the backend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 3     |       |
| 4/17/25 | Updated the script to update the add food forms for both the user food table and the search food api. Got the post request to add a new food from the search food api to add the food to the user food table and add the new food to the tracker. Added Javadoc and comments to java classes. Added/fixed the ability to advance a week ahead in the tracker or go back a week.                                                       | 7     |       |
