# Weekly Reflection

Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles.


### Week 2

1/30/2025 - 2.5 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Chose a project goal
 * Created this repository
 * Wrote the problem statement
 * Started documenting the project plan
 * Began listing technologies and how they fit in this project


### Week 3

2/09/2025 - 3 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Updated user stories and denoted MVPs
 * Updated readme with possible technologies 
 * Brainstormed screen designs
 * Looked into food nutrition APIs
   * this is giving me some issues as most food APIs are a paid service 
   * may have to instead have each user manually input their food(s)/meal(s) into local database,
   * then they can query that database. 
 * Weekly reflection

I have a pretty good idea of where I want to go with this project. I still need to design some wireframes
of what each page will/might look like and will get them done before the 2/12 due date. 
Need to keep researching if there are any free/easy to use APIs with food/nutrition data. If all else fails
users can create their own local database with food they have entered themselves and can re-use those items
over and over again.

#### Week 4 
2/12/2025

Task completed:
* Created the screens for each webpage
