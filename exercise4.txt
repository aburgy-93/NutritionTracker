Add a DAO that uses Hibernate and performs at LEAST full CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) on the javabean.
Add unit tests to thoroughly test each method in your DAO.
Take a screen shot showing your dao tests passing and code coverage on the Dao class/es. Add the screen shot to your repository or Slack it to your instructor.
Commit and push your code to your repository on GitHub

Create an issue in GitHub to notify your instructor that your work is complete. Go to your repository in GitHub.com, click on issues, and then New issue.

For issue title, use something like: "Week 4 ready for review".
In the issue detail, add something like "@pawaitemadisoncollege week 3 is complete". The @pawaitemadisoncollege portion is very important as that will send me a notification.
Within the issue reflect on your learning experience and work for the week by answering, at minimum, the following:
    What were your key learning points/takeaways?
    What challenged you?
    What problems did you solve and what resources did you use to solve them? If you struggle with option 2, start with option 1 to understand the details of set up since the exercise provides more guidance.
