### Sign up *
As a new user I want to create and account, so I can track, edit, view my daily meals
to see how close I am at reaching my nutritional goals each day. 

### Sign in *
As a registered user I want to set my own nutritional goals so that each day I can 
track what I eat to see how close to my goals I get each day. 

I want to be able to view each meal, edit meals if I made a mistake, and delete meals
if needed.

### Add meals or individual food(s) *
If there is a meal I have or food that I eat regularly I want to be able to save its
information, so I can reuse it later and not have to re-enter its nutritional data. 

### Edit User Profile *
As a user I would like to be able to update my nutritional goals as needed. Some phases
someone may need to eat more or less depending on their goals, so being able to update
how much food you need to eat in a day is important to users. 

### Password Reset *
As a user I want to be able to reset my password if I forget it.
